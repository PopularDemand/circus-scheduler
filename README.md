## Current Issue

The U.S. and international circus community is using Facebook groups to promote workshops, trainings, and special events. The Facebook posts are disorganized and difficult to search.

----
## Solution

This app gives studio representatives the ability to post upcoming events. The public can easily search for events by studio, geographic region, workshop type, and date.

----
## Future Features

* Directory of aerial performance and circus studios
* Audition listings
* Studio profiles
* Aerialist profiles
